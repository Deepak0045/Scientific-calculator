# Scientific Calculator

This project is a comprehensive Python-based scientific calculator built with `tkinter` for the user interface and `math` for advanced scientific calculations. The calculator supports a variety of functions, including basic arithmetic, trigonometric operations, logarithmic calculations, and more, providing a robust tool for mathematical computations.

## Topics Covered

1. **Basic Operations**
   * Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

2. **Clear and Reset Functions**
   * Clear Last Character (`C`)
   * Clear Entire Entry (`CE`)

3. **Trigonometric Functions**
   * **Sine (sinθ)**: Computes sine of an angle in degrees
   * **Cosine (cosθ)**: Computes cosine of an angle in degrees
   * **Tangent (tanθ)**: Computes tangent of an angle in degrees
   * **Hyperbolic Sine (sinh)**, **Cosine (cosh)**, and **Tangent (tanh)**

4. **Logarithmic and Exponential Functions**
   * **Natural Logarithm (ln)**: Computes the natural logarithm (base e)
   * **Base-10 Logarithm (log₁₀)**: Computes the logarithm base 10
   * **Euler’s Number (e)**: Constant value of `e ≈ 2.718`
   * **Exponential Power (xʸ)**: Allows exponentiation with user-defined powers

5. **Power and Root Operations**
   * **Square (x²)**: Squares a number
   * **Cube (x³)**: Cubes a number
   * **Square Root (√)**: Calculates the square root of a number
   * **Cube Root (∛)**: Calculates the cube root of a number

6. **Factorial and Constants**
   * **Factorial (x!)**: Computes the factorial of a number
   * **Pi (π)**: Constant value of π
   * **2π**: Calculates 2 times the value of π

7. **Angle Conversions**
   * **Degrees (deg)**: Converts radians to degrees
   * **Radians (rad)**: Converts degrees to radians

8. **Special Symbols and Formatting**
   * **Superscript Notation (xʸ)**: Allows entry of exponents
   * **Division Symbol (÷)**: Displays the division symbol for user-friendly input
